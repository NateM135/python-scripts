This is a simple script that will take a user's account token and spam in a specified channel.

This can be used to help with Discord games that rely on activities for spawns, such as Pokecord, WaifuBot, etc.

Every second, the bot will send the message ``here is a message plus a string`` along with a random number from 1 -> 1,000,000. This will bypass most of the common checks that bots have for spammers.

You have to configure a few things for the bot to work properly.

On line 18, you need to put the GUILD ID of the server you want spam to show up in.

On line 19, you need to put the CHANNEL ID of the channel you want the spam to show up in.

Finally, you need to put your token inside the quotes on line 8.

It is important to note that this bot is a SELFBOT, not a normal userbot. If you plan to use this, use it on an alternate account as it is against the terms of service. While Discord will not go out of their way to ban you for using a selfbot, it does give them cause to ban and it's best to avoid that.
