BullyBot is a bot based on the concept of making it hard for someone to use Discord in the server it is active in.

It accomplishes this using two functions: insta-deleting messages and permanent server mute.

When someone attempts to send a message, it is instantly deleted by the bot. 

When someone attempts to remove the server mute on them, it server mutes them again.

See the video below to see it in action.
