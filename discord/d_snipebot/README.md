# Description

A Discord SnipeBot is a bot that works with a webhook to take recently deleted messages in a channel and resend them to the channel in a way that looks as if the original sender sent the information.

You can see how this looks from the thumbnail of the video above or see the entire process of configuring the bot + examples in the video above.

This bot was programmed using discord.py, and is intended for use with a single guild.
